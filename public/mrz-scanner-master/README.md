# Quickstart

## Web demo

The web demo is at https://alsenet-labs.github.io/mrz-scanner/dist/index.html (nothing is uploaded)

## Web demo from filesystem
The code is "same-origin friendly". That means it can be run in the browser from the filesystem (no web server required), with eg:

### Use the prebuilt static version
```
git clone https://github.com/alsenet-labs/mrz-scanner
xdg-open mrz-scanner/dist/index.html
```

### Rebuild and run the static version
```
git clone https://github.com/alsenet-labs/mrz-scanner
cd mrz-scanner
npm install
gulp dist
xdg-open dist/index.html
```

## Web demo from web server

You can build the scripts, start a web server and open a browser, with eg:
```
git clone https://github.com/alsenet-labs/mrz-scanner
cd mrz-scanner
npm start
```

## Command line tool
You can also scan documents from the command line using this repository or the latest published npm package.
On success the result will be stored in a file suffixed by ".mrz.json" along the original image by default.

### Using this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/alsenet-labs/mrz-scanner
cd mrz-scanner
npm install .
mrz2json [ -d|--dest-dir <directory> ] <png_or_jpg_or_tiff> [...]
```

### Using the latest published npm package

```
npm install -g mrz-scanner
mrz2json [ -d|--dest-dir <directory> ] <jpg_or_png_or_tiff> [...]
```
